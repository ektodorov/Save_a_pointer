Save_a_pointer
==============

Shows how to serialize a pointer to disk. Deselrialize it and use it to access the object it pointed to, ofcourse if that object is still alive. If it is not, you could get garbadge, exception or segmentation fault.

Yes we all know how dangerous this is, and I don't recommend it.<br>
I am just saying it is possible.
